This program **exports a metabolic reaction network from a %(contigs-db)s to a JSON file** suitable for inspection and flux balance analysis.

A reaction network must first be inferred from the genome using KEGG Ortholog annotations of protein-coding genes. This is accomplished by the program, %(anvi-reaction-network)s, which stores the network in tables of a %(contigs-db)s. %(anvi-get-metabolic-model-file)s takes this database as input and writes a JSON-formatted file that is suitable for flux balance analysis and other analyses using metabolic modeling software. An "objective function" representing the biomass of metabolites in the "core metabolism" of E. coli is automatically added to the output file (as the first entry among "reactions"), and can be deleted as needed.
