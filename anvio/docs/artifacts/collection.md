An anvi'o concept that describes one or more %(bin)ss.

You can generate and store a collection by selecting items on any anvi'o %(interactive)s interface or by importing them via %(anvi-import-collection)s into any anvi'o database that can store collections using the file format %(collection-txt)s.

You can always use the program %(anvi-show-collections-and-bins)s to list all collections and bins stored in a given anvi'o database.

Collections are used in many ways in anvi'o depending on your workflow as you can see from the number of programs that require or can make use of the concept %(collection)s.
