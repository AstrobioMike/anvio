A flat text HMM that literally desribes the properties of the model and lists transition probabilities.

Such files are typically generated by the program `hmmbuild` (which is a part of the [HMMER](http://hmmer.org/) package and installed in every anvi'o environment) from FASTA files of aligned sequnces.
