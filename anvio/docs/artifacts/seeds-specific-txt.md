This tabular file contains data on the specific coverages of tRNA-seq seeds.

Specific coverage represents reads that are assigned uniquely to a tRNA seed. See the %(trnaseq-profile-db)s artifact for a fuller explanation of specific versus nonspecific coverage. The rows and columns of this table are identical to %(seeds-nonspecific-txt)s except the type of coverage data reported in each.

This file is produced by %(anvi-tabulate-trnaseq)s. The artifact for that program describes this and related tables in detail.

This tab-delimited file can be easily manipulated by the user. It is required input for %(anvi-plot-trnaseq)s.
