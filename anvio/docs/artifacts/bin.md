In its simplest form, **a group of items** that are put together. Think of a literal bin in which you put data. One or more bins in anvi'o form a %(collection)s.

In anvi'o, a bin may reprsent one or more contigs, or gene clusters, or any item that can be shown in the interactive interface and stored in a %(profile-db)s, %(pan-db)s, or %(genes-db)s.

Bin names become handy to specifically target a group of items to investigate via programs such as %(anvi-refine)s or %(anvi-split)s, specify a group of contigs in files such as %(internal-genomes)s, or find them in output files anvi'o generates via programs such as %(anvi-summarize)s or %(anvi-estimate-genome-completeness)s.

Since they are a part of the umbrella concept %(collection)s, information about bins are stored in various anvi'o databases, each of which can be used with the program %(anvi-show-collections-and-bins)s to see the bin content.
