This artifact represents **the metabolic reaction network stored in a %(contigs-db)s by %(anvi-reaction-network)s.**

Sufficient data is stored regarding the properties of the reactions and metabolites and their association with %(kegg-functions)s to export a metabolic model using %(anvi-get-metabolic-model-file)s.

The network is stored in two tables of the %(contigs-db)s: `gene_function_reactions` and `gene_function_metabolites`.
