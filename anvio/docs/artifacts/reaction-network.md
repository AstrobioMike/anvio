This artifact represents **the metabolic reaction network stored in a %(contigs-db)s or a %(pan-db)s by %(anvi-reaction-network)s.**

The program, %(anvi-reaction-network)s, generates a reaction network from genes encoding enzymes in the %(contigs-db)s or from gene clusters with consensus enzyme annotations in the %(pan-db)s. The reaction network represents biochemical reactions and the constituent metabolites predicted from the genome or pangenome. The program relies upon [KEGG Orthology (KO)](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html) annotations of protein-coding genes and reference data in the [ModelSEED Biochemistry database](https://github.com/ModelSEED/ModelSEEDDatabase), and is therefore subject to all the limitations thereof, including incomplete annotation of genes with protein orthologs and imprecise knowledge of the reactions catalyzed by enzymes.

The representation of the reaction network in two tables of the %(contigs-db)s, `gene_function_reactions` and `gene_function_metabolites`, is generalizable to other sources of metabolic data, linking genes to predicted functional orthologs and the associated reactions and metabolites. Reaction and metabolite data are likewise stored in the identically formatted tables, `gene_cluster_function_reactions` and `gene_cluster_function_metabolites`, in the %(pan-db)s. This data can be exported to a JSON-formatted file by %(anvi-get-metabolic-model-file)s for inspection and metabolic model analyses.
