This program **generates a metabolic reaction network in a %(contigs-db)s.** Gene %(functions)s that have been annotated in the %(contigs-db)s are compared to reference databases, yielding predictions of the biochemical reactions that may be catalyzed by the gene products. Possible applications of anvi'o metabolic networks include the export of draft metabolic models (see %(anvi-get-metabolic-model-file)s) and the import and integration of metabolomic datasets.

A network can currently be generated from KEGG Orthology (KO) annotations of genes in conjunction with %(reaction-ref-data)s: KEGG (KO, REACTION, and COMPOUND) databases and the ModelSEED Biochemistry database. The reference databases must have been downloaded and set up by %(anvi-setup-protein-reference-database)s.
