                    Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Why did you bring us here? We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!
                    All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
                    Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… No! The cat shelter's on to me. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.
                    A sexy mistake. Ooh, name it after me! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages!
                    No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! We don't have a brig.

                    Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?
                    I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
                    No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Yeah, lots of people did. And I'm his friend Jesus. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!
                    I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. When will that be? Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
                    Throw her in the brig. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. And why did 'I' have to take a cab? The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
                    Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! No, just a regular mistake. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."
                    For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Can I use the gun? Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!
