The purpose of this directory is to keep track of people who are a
part of the anvi'o project. If you see someone who is missing,
please add them into the relevant file, and put a photo of them
into the `AVATARS` directory. Every person mentioned in either
of these files must have a GitHub username.

## Developers vs Contributors

`DEVELOPERS.yaml` contains individuals who has made literal contributions
to the anvi'o codebase. The information in this file can be used to
tag people in `__authors__` directives in anvi'o programs under the
`bin/` and `sandbox/` directories, which then can be used via the
`anvio/authors.py` module that serves other programs such as
`anvi-script-gen-help-pages` that generates anvi'o help pages at
https://anvio.org/help/main

`CONTRIBUTORS.yaml` contains individuals has made indirect contributions
to the anvi'o community, including writing blog posts or tutorials, or
pushing the boundaries of the platform with their intellectual
contributions and guidance.

## Intellectual contributions

We have manually curated 'intellectual contributions' sections for
individuals listed in both `DEVELOPERS.yaml` and `CONTRIBUTORS.yaml`.
At any given time, they will be inevitably incomplete. So please help
expand these entries to keep track of key contributions even for
those who are no longer around the project. Here are a few right-hand
rules to add more:

* Keep each contributons statement as concise and accruate as possible.
HTML notation is supported, but please limit the use of HTML to `a`
tags to link relevant documentation, PRs, help pages, or articles from
within the contrib statement.

* Each contributions statement must list a single contribution.

* If someone implemented an entirely new concept, program, workflow,
document, or framework in anvi'o, use the term 'Spearheaded'. I.e.,
"Spearheaded the development of anvi'o snakemake workflows". This
indicates that others may have contributed to it, or may contribute
in the future.

* If someone made notable contributions anything listed above, use
the phares "Made significant contributions". I.e., "Made significant
contributions to anvi'o snakemake workflows". What is notable and
what is not notable is not clear. Common sense is your best guidance,
but when you are unsure, discuss a given case with other developers.
A contribution may be notable only by you, so if you see something,
say something!

## Affiliations

We try to keep track of every anvi'o person starting from their first
contribution to the platform. Please help us keep thse up-to-date.
