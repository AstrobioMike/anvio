Code contributions to anvi'o as recognized by GitHub can be viewed here:

    https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/graphs/contributors

Although, code contributions represent only a fraction of the investment the
anvi'o community has made into this platform. For instance, the list by GitHub
does not include those who contributed to the platform by submitting issues,
writing tutorials, making suggestions, or helping other anvi'o users, even
though it is these kinds of contributions that keeps a software platform
alive and relevant. Thus, we maintain a more comprehensive and up-to-date
list of the "anvi'o people" here:
